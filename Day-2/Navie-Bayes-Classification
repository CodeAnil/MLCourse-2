#Naive Bayes Classifier

Where to use Naive Bayes: If all the variables are independent we need to use Naive Bayes Classification




#Confusion Matrix in Machine Learning

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/

Classification Rate/Accuracy:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)= (100+50) /(100+5+10+50)= 0.90

Recall: Recall gives us an idea about when itâ€™s actually yes, how often does it predict yes.
Recall=TP / (TP + FN)=100/(100+5)=0.95

Precision: Precsion tells us about when it predicts yes, how often is it correct.
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)=100/ (100+10)=0.91

F-measure: is a Harmonic Mean
Fmeasure=(2*Recall*Precision)/(Recall+Precision)=(2*0.95*0.91)/(0.91+0.95)=0.92

Harmonic Mean Formula: 2*(x)*(y)/(x+y)

Here is a python script which demonstrates how to create a confusion matrix on a predicted model.For this, we have to import confusion matrix module from sklearn library which helps us to generate the confusion matrix.
