AI vs ML:

Automation is part AI
Solution is ML

AI is SuperSet
--> Model -->

The process of marking as a spam is ML

In ML -- you have to understand Data
DL -- System will learn

#there is no feature learning


Supervised Learning: Trained AI Model
Unsupervised learning: UnTrained AI Model
Reinforce Learning: Agent will Decide( Agent have some special permissions like Manager)


Self driven cars uses some of Reinforcement Learning


#Applicatons:
Bio Metrics
#Behavioral bio metrics  is driven AI

Supervised Learning Algorithms:

1. Linear Regression --
Regression -- Previous Data

Linear Regression:  is a technique to predict unknown variable(Dependent variable)
from the known value of another variables( Independent Variable)

y = mx+c

Home price example
Price vs Square Feet

Dependent Variable: Price (Predicting unknown value)
Independent variable: Square feet
Regression Line:

# if we have single dependent value, its fine
# if we have multiple dependent values
Age vs Immunity

# Understand variables
# talk with Domain Experts

Libraries:

# scikit Lib:
# Pandas
# numpy
# seaborn
# Matplot

Pandas: Multi Dimensional
# Outcome of Linear Regression: Continuous Variable

Need to give videos of Reinforcement Videos

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Train, Test, validation
