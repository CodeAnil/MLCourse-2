Why we use Decision Tree rather than Logistic Regression?
1. If you want to have multiple classification we use D.T but Logistic Regression can give one classification


#Decision Tree
#What is decision tree?

@ you can classify multi classes using Decision Tree
@ Model which is explainable

Random Forest: Is not explainable
RFA(Random Forest Accuracy) vs Decision accuracy difference

RFA-Decision Tree = 3% to 8%

Random Forest:

Random Forest is an ensemble classifier made using many decision tree models.

When you use decison tree vs Random Forest:
1. When you want your model to be simple and explainable
2. When you want non parameter Model.


When to use Random Forest:
If you want to have multiple classifications.


@ regularisation -- to check your model is over fit or not.  To basically to remove over fitting
